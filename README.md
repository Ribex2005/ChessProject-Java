# ChessProject-Java
This is my first project that I created using Java. I made a 2player chess game. It is still under progress.
I created an abstract Piece class that is inherited by 6 classes (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Pawn and Knight) and handles the movement and capture logic of all the Pieces.
I created a Board class that consists of a 8x8 Chess Board and Pieces.
I created a Player class to keep a track of the Players and the captured pieces.
I created the ChessGame class as a Driver Class.
